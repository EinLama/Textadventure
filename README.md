# Textadventure

Just a small experiment for `#instance_eval` and all the stuff you can do with it.

Serves as a subject for my talk at Cologne.rb in May 2012. This is not intended for serious use, just for fun and discussing.

To run it:

* Clone the repo
* Run `textadventure.rb` with ruby 1.9.x

Type 'help' if prompted to start the game.
